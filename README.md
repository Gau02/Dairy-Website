# Fresh Dairy India Website

## Project Description
This is a simple static website for a fictional dairy business in India called "Fresh Dairy India". The website is built using only HTML and CSS, with no JavaScript or external dependencies. It consists of four pages: Home, About Us, Products, and Contact. The design is responsive, clean, and focused on providing basic information about the dairy products and business.

### Features:
- **Home Page**: Welcomes visitors with a hero section and highlights key features.
- **About Us Page**: Provides background information on the business.
- **Products Page**: Lists available dairy products with prices.
- **Contact Page**: Displays contact details like email, phone, and address.
- **Navigation**: A simple menu bar for easy navigation between pages.
- **Styling**: Uses CSS for layout, colors, and responsiveness. The site uses a green theme to evoke freshness and nature.

The website is mobile-friendly thanks to the meta viewport tag and flexible CSS layouts.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The home page.
- `about.html`: The about us page.
- `products.html`: The products page.
- `contact.html`: The contact page.
- `styles.css`: The shared CSS stylesheet for all pages.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Execute the Project
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Download the files from GitHub or clone the repository using Git:
2. **Open in a Browser**: No server is required. Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) by double-clicking the file or dragging it into the browser window.
3. **View Other Pages**: Navigate using the menu links, or open other HTML files directly.
4. **Customization**: Edit the HTML files for content changes or `styles.css` for design tweaks. No build tools are needed.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structure.
- CSS3 for styling and layout.

## Notes
- This is a static site, so contact forms are not functional (just placeholders). For real functionality, add backend services.
- Images are not included; you can add them by placing image files in the project folder and linking via `<img>` tags in HTML.
- Tested on desktop and mobile browsers for basic responsiveness.
